# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end
# db/seeds.rb
require 'faker'

# Create the initial users
first_user = User.create(name: 'Tom', photo: 'https://unsplash.com/photos/F_-0BxGuVvo', bio: 'Teacher from Mexico.')
second_user = User.create(name: 'Lilly', photo: 'https://unsplash.com/photos/F_-0BxGuVvo', bio: 'Teacher from Poland.')

# Create 8 more users with Faker
8.times do
  User.create(
    name: Faker::Name.name,
    photo: Faker::Internet.url('example.com'),
    bio: Faker::Lorem.sentence
  )
